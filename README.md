## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed on your computer:

- Python 3.7 or later
- PySimpleGUI
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLOv5

### Installing

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/farisrfp/battery-classification-app
```

2. Install the required libraries:

3. Run the YOLOv5 app:
```
python yolov5_app.py
```
4. Use the PySimpleGUI interface to select an input image or video, and a YOLOv5 model to use for object detection.

5. Slide the "Model Confidence" slider to adjust the confidence threshold for the object detection algorithm.
